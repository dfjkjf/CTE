## 名词性从句

**<u>Tom</u> will go to <u>Shanghai</u> <u>for work</u> <u>by plane</u> <u>next Tuesday</u>.**

### 转换为疑问句

- 方法
    - 将句中需要提问的部分替换为相应的疑问代词，并将其至于居首，将助动词放在疑问代词后面，并将处于句尾的句号改为问号。
- 例子
    - `What` will Tome do next Tuesday?
    - `Who` will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday?
    - `Where` will Tom go for work by plane next Tuesday?
    - `How` will Tom go to Shanghai for work next Tuesday?
    - `When` will Tom go to Shanghai for work by plane?

### 转换为从句

- 方法1
    - 将句中需要提问的部分替换为相应的疑问代词，并将其至于居首。

### it：形式主语和形式宾语

为避免句子头重脚轻，理解难度较大，使用`it`来替换句子中的主语和宾语。

`Whether Tom will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday` has not yet been announced.</br>
将`it`置于主语位置，将原来的主语置于句尾。</br>
`It` has not yet been announced `whether Tom will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday`.

Nobody considers `how Tom will go to Shanghai for work next Tuesday` desirable.</br>
将`it`置于宾语位置，将原来的宾语置于句尾。</br>
